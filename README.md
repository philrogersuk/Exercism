# Exercism.io code samples

My solutions from working through [exercism.io](https://exercism.io) code exercises. 

I decided to use these to quickly run through some basic exercises as a refresher as well as remind myself of more complex
problems and algorithms I tend not to tackle in everyday work.

Currently this repository only contains the first few Java problems, but should expand over time to include all Java solutions
as well as potentially other languages.

In the spirit of simply writing the necessary code to pass the tests (YAGNI), these samples often omit validation of input.
Clearly this should usually be included, but in the interests of focusing on the task given I've omitted it.

## Requirements

These code samples assume at least the following versions

- JavaSE 8
- Gradle 6.x

## Running the tests

You can run all the tests for an exercise by entering the following in your
terminal on Unix/Linux/Mac OS from the root of each project folder:

```sh
$ ./gradlew test
```

Or the following on Windows:

```sh
$ gradlew.bat test
```
